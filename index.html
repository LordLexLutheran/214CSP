He was widely known as a military strategist, it was reported that it was mainly due to his abilities that the weaker and smaller state of Shu was able to resist the much larger Wei army for a quite some time.[1] In death, Kongming still outsmarted Zhongda. (Due to the "extremely peculiar circumstances" of the Grand Orders, Lord El-Melloi II was forced to become a receptacle for his spirit to facilitate a successful summoning. Lord El-Melloi II himself lacks the means or history to become a Heroic Spirit. In the process, the Master Strategist analyzed who would be best in charge. Kongming judged that there was no need for himself to come to the forefront, since he already had a competent agent, so the role fell to Lord El-Melloi II, who was already acquainted with the modern era.)</p>
